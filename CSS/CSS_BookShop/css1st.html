                an English playwright, poet, and actor. He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English
                language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.[4][5][6] He is often called England's national poet and
                the "Bard of Avon" (or simply "the Bard"). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some
                39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship.
                His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those
                of any other playwright.[7] Shakespeare remains arguably the most influential writer in the English
                language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.

        <li>Harry Potter:</li>
        <div class="x"><img src="hp.jpg" alt="">
            <p> is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the
                lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are
                students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's conflict
                with Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body
                known as the Ministry of Magic, and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).
            </p>
        </div>
        <li>The Alchemist:</li>
        <div class="x">
            <img src="alcha_.jpg" alt="">
            <p>(Portuguese: O Alquimista) is a novel by Brazilian author Paulo Coelho which was first published in 1988.
                Originally written in Portuguese, it became a widely translated international bestseller.[1][2] The
                story follows the shepherd boy Santiago in his journey across North Africa to the pyramids of Egypt
                after he dreams of finding a treasure there.
            </p>
        </div>
        <li>Beauty and the Beast:</li>
        <div class="x">
            <img src="bb.jpg" alt="">
            <p>(French: La Belle et la Bête) is a fairy tale written by French novelist Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de
                Villeneuve and published in 1740 in La Jeune Américaine et les contes marins (The Young American and
                Marine Tales).[1][2] Her lengthy version was abridged, rewritten, and published by French novelist
                Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont in 1756 in Magasin des enfants[3] (Children's Collection) to produce
                the version most commonly retold.[4] Later, Andrew Lang retold the story in Blue Fairy Book, a part of
                the Fairy Book series, in 1889.[5] The fairy tale was influenced by the story of Petrus Gonsalvus[6] as
                well as Ancient Greek stories such as "Cupid and Psyche" from The Golden Ass, written by Lucius Apuleius
                Madaurensis in the second century AD, and "The Pig King", an Italian fairytale published by Giovanni
                Francesco Straparola in The Facetious Nights of Straparola around 1550.[7]

        </div>
        <li>The God Delusion:</li>
        <div class="x"><img src="The_God_Delusion_UK.jpg" alt="">
            <p>is a 2006 book by British evolutionary biologist and ethologist Richard Dawkins. In The God Delusion,
                Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator, God, almost certainly does not exist, and that belief in a
                personal god qualifies as a delusion, which he defines as a persistent false belief held in the face of
                strong contradictory evidence. He is sympathetic to Robert Pirsig's statement in Lila (1991) that when
                one person suffers from a delusion it is called insanity. When many people suffer from a delusion it is
                called religion. In the book, Dawkins explores the relationship between religion and morality, providing
                examples that discuss the possibility of morality existing independently of religion and suggesting
                alternative explanations for the origins of both religion and morality.
